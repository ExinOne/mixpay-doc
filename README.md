## Introduction

MixPay is a decentralized instant payment platform built on the Mixin Network. You only need to specify a certain amount of currency to MixPay, the user chooses any cryptocurrency to pay, and MixPay will automatically exchange it. For example, suppose there is a current commodity valued at $10 that needs to be traded, the merchant can choose to charge $10 in BTC or any cryptocurrency, and the user can choose to pay $10 in USDT or any cryptocurrency. And all this can be achieved only by scanning the QR code using Mixin Messenger.

## Getting started

Assuming that you want the other party to pay $10, the other party can choose to use cryptocurrency to pay. At this time, we need to create a link that allows the other party to evoke Mixin payment. You can get the complete parameters for evoke Mixin payment from the interface below to transfer assets.
